# Tailwind Demo

This demo coincides with [lesson materials](https://github.com/SWIC-177/curriculum-content/blob/main/week-8.md#tailwind-refactor-%EF%B8%8F-example). Follow along with those!

## Forking and/or Cloning

If you want to get this code down to your computer to play around with, you can just click that green button and use the GitHub CLI to `clone` it: `gh repo clone SWIC-177/tailwind-demo`. Just make sure that it's not being cloned into any other repo! From there, it's the same: `cd` into the newly cloned directory (you can do `ls` first). And then `npm i`, etc. etc. etc.

Just cloning it though will not allow you to **push** any updates. You probably don't need to as you are supposed to work on your own repo from before. But, in case you do, you just need to click that 'Fork' button in the top right. That will make a copy to your own GitHub account and then you can `clone` it.
