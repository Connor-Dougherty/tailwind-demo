## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo into your `Code` directory (or a subdirectory of your choice). **DO NOT** clone this repo into another git repo!
1. `cd` into the directory you cloned the repo into.
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. ⚠️ Once you start this development server, you will not be able to interact with the terminal. It's busy running the Vite bundler and the live server. You will need to open a new terminal tab/window to run any other commands.
